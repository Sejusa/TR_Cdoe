AI code using Nvidia NeMo to create audio to text and text to audio AI for TR (research paper).
This research explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through Nvidia
NeMo and Google Colab to create a functional AI system. AI refers to the ability of
machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as
learning, reasoning, and natural language processing. Motivated by the rapid
advancements in AI technologies, the study aims to understand its inner workings
and develop a system capable of transcribing audio to text and generating English audio from text inputs.
The research is divided into theoretical and practical components. The theoretical
part involves studying AI fundamentals and understanding Nvidia NeMo and Google
Colab, focusing on their roles in AI development. The practical part involves coding
in Python, leveraging libraries, and utilizing Google Colab as the primary
environment for creating and training the AI system. Nvidia NeMo is used for speech
and text processing tasks, while Colab provides computational resources like GPUs
for efficient model training.
The outcomes highlight the capabilities of combining Nvidia NeMo and Google Colab
to develop AI models for speech-to-text and text-to-speech tasks.
